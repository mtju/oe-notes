An abnormal termination can result in some combination of the following dump files:
• procore file
    A list of recent ABL (Advanced Business Language) messages, by message number
    • An ABL procedure stack trace that includes line numbers from the debug listing file within each
    procedure
    OpenEdge writes the procore file to a temporary directory, if you specify the Temporary Directory
    (-T) startup parameter; otherwise, OpenEdge writes the procore file to the current working
    directory. Refer to Procedures and triggers on page 32.
• protrace file
    • A stack trace of the ABL Virtual Machine (AVM) or other OpenEdge process (such as a database
    server or utility) that terminated abnormally
    • A stack trace of the executing ABL program itself, where applicable
    • A list of the persistent procedures or classes that are in memory, with their handle IDs
    • A list of startup parameters in effect for the ABL session
    • Symbolic information (when available)
• core file
    • A stack trace of the AVM executing ABL code
    • Hex representation of the parameters to each routine
